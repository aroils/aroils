          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Established in 1967 by A. Ranganathan, 
            our family-run business has proudly upheld the tradition of producing high-quality 
            edible oils for over five decades. Using the age-old wood press (chekku) method, 
            we extract groundnut oil, sesame oil, and coconut oil, preserving their natural aroma, 
            flavor, and nutritional value. What began as a humble endeavor by Mr. Ranganathan has
             now been carried forward by his children with the same dedication, authenticity,
              and commitment to purity. Today, we continue to blend tradition with trust,
               delivering wholesome oils that generations have relied on.
              AR OILS is dedicated to providing high-quality cooking oils sourced from the finest ingredients. 
             Our mission is to promote healthy cooking and enhance culinary experiences with our premium oils.</p>
